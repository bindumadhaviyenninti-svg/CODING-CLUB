## Week 1 — 19/08/2026: Intro & Orientation

## Week 2 — 02/09/2026: AI & Machine Learning Basics

### 1. Generative AI

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can **create new content** — instead of just analyzing existing data, it generates something new based on patterns it has learned from the data it was given.

**Examples of what it can generate:**
- Text (essays, code, conversations) — e.g., ChatGPT, Claude
- Images — e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney
- Audio/music
- Video

**How it works (simple idea):** These models are trained on huge amounts of existing data (text, images, etc.). By studying patterns in that data, they learn to produce new, original content that resembles what they were trained on. For any given sentence, it first converts the text into tokens (numerical representations) and generates output from them — this process is called **tokenization**. Some AI tools have minimum/maximum token limits — for example, Claude has an upload limit on how much file content it can process at once.

**Real-world use cases:** writing assistance, chatbots, image generation, code generation, customer support automation.

### 2. Large Language Models (LLMs)

An LLM is a specific type of generative AI model that is trained specifically on **text data** to understand and generate human-like language. Simply put, it generates textual conversation.

**How they work (simplified):**
- Trained on massive amounts of text from books, websites, articles, etc.
- They learn to predict the **next word (or "token")** in a sentence, based on everything that came before it.
- By doing this repeatedly at a huge scale, they learn grammar, facts, reasoning patterns, and conversational style.

**Examples of LLMs:** GPT (used in ChatGPT), Claude, Gemini, LLaMA.

**What they're used for:** answering questions, summarizing text, writing content, coding help, translation, and more.

### 2.1 Diffusion Models

A **diffusion model** is a type of generative AI model, mainly used to generate **images** (and increasingly audio/video), by learning to gradually build a clear image out of random noise. It differs from an LLM — an LLM can only generate text, whereas diffusion models can generate audio, text, video, and images.

**How they work (simplified):**
- During training, the model is shown real images that have random "noise" (like static) added to them in small steps, until the image becomes pure noise.
- The model learns exactly how to **reverse** this process — removing a tiny bit of noise at each step.
- Once trained, to generate a new image, the model starts with **pure random noise** and repeatedly removes noise step by step, guided by a text prompt, until a clear image forms.

**Simple analogy:** Like a sculptor starting with a rough, shapeless block (random noise) and slowly chiseling away the excess (removing noise) until a clear statue (final image) appears — guided by a description of what to create.

**Examples of diffusion models:** DALL·E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion.

**What they're used for:** text-to-image generation, image editing/inpainting, and increasingly video and audio generation.

### Algorithms in AI/Machine Learning

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of rules or instructions that a computer follows to solve a problem or complete a task. In AI and machine learning, algorithms are the core logic that lets a system learn patterns from data, make predictions, or make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

**Common types include:**
- **Supervised learning algorithms** (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes) — learn from labeled data
- **Unsupervised learning algorithms** (e.g., k-means clustering) — find patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement learning algorithms** (e.g., Q-learning) — learn through trial, error, and reward
- **Neural networks / deep learning algorithms** — model complex patterns using layered structures inspired by the brain

### 3. Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is the broader field that AI models (including LLMs) come from — it's about teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed with rules. There are three main types:

**a) Supervised Learning**

The model learns from **labeled data** — meaning each training example has a known correct answer. Simply put, we give both inputs and outputs to the machine.

- **Example:** Giving the model past house prices along with details like size/location, so it learns to predict the price of a new house.
- **Common uses:** spam detection, price prediction, image classification.

**b) Unsupervised Learning**

The model works with **unlabeled data** — there's no "correct answer" given. It tries to find hidden patterns or groupings on its own. Simply put, we give only input, and it gives us output based on patterns from the data used.

- **Example:** Grouping customers into segments based on shopping behavior, without being told the groups in advance.
- **Common uses:** customer segmentation, anomaly detection, recommendation systems.

**c) Reinforcement Learning**

The model learns by **trial and error**, receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones, gradually improving its strategy over time. Simply put, the agent interacts with the environment and gets rewards or penalties.

- **Example:** An AI learning to play a game by playing it repeatedly and getting better with each attempt.
- Or: a dog performs an action (like sitting); the environment (you) gives a reward (a treat) if it's correct.
- **Common uses:** game-playing AI, robotics, self-driving car decision-making.
